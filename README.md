# ChEMBL Drug Discovery Regression Model with Random Forest

Welcome to the ChEMBL Drug Discovery Regression Model with Random Forest project! This project aims to predict the biological activity of compounds using the ChEMBL database, a valuable resource for drug discovery. We will build a Random Forest regression model to make predictions and evaluate its performance.

## Introduction

Chemical compounds with known biological activities are crucial for drug discovery and development. The ChEMBL database provides a wealth of data on chemical compounds and their biological activities, making it an ideal source for building predictive models. In this project, we will focus on creating a regression model to predict the biological activity of compounds based on their chemical descriptors.

## Project Overview

We will break down the project into several steps:

### Getting Started

1. **Data Collection**: Obtain the ChEMBL dataset with compound data and biological activity measurements.
2. **Python Environment Setup**: Set up your Python environment with the necessary libraries for data analysis and machine learning.

### Data Preprocessing

3. **Data Cleaning**: Clean the dataset to handle missing values, duplicates, and outliers.
4. **Feature Selection**: Select relevant features from the dataset for modeling.

### EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis)

5. **Data Visualization**: Explore the dataset through visualization to gain insights into the data.
6. **Statistical Analysis**: Perform statistical analysis to understand data distributions, correlations, and patterns.

### Descriptors Preparation

7. **Chemical Descriptors Calculation**: Calculate chemical descriptors (molecular properties) for compounds. Tools like RDKit or Cheminformatics can be used for this purpose.

### Random Forest Regression

8. **Train a Random Forest Model**: Build a regression model using the Random Forest algorithm. You can use libraries like scikit-learn for this.

### Evaluation of Machine Learning Models

9. **Model Evaluation**: Evaluate the model using appropriate metrics (e.g., R-squared, RMSE, MAE).
10. **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Optimize the Random Forest model by tuning hyperparameters.
11. **Comparing Regressors**: Optionally, you can compare the Random Forest model's performance with other regression algorithms.

## Getting Started

Before you begin, ensure you have the following prerequisites:

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook or a Python IDE
- Required Python libraries (e.g., scikit-learn, pandas, matplotlib)
- ChEMBL dataset (downloadable from the ChEMBL website)

For step-by-step instructions, code samples, and detailed explanations for each of the above steps, please refer to the Jupyter Notebook or Python script included in this project's repository.
